# üìä Atlas Labs HR Analytics ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview
- This project involves analyzing HR data for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs.
- The goal is to derive insights about employee demographics, performance, and attrition patterns.
- The primary purpose is to help Atlas Labs understand workforce trends and improve employee retention strategies.
- The project utilizes Power BI tools to create interactive dashboards for data-driven HR decisions.
- It enables Atlas Labs leadership to monitor key HR metrics and identify factors impacting employee satisfaction and retention.

## üìë Project Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Modeling and Exploratory Analysis
- Imported multiple HR datasets into **Power BI** and established relationships between tables.
- Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query** to handle missing values and standardize formats.
- Performed initial exploration to understand workforce composition and trends.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance and Satisfaction Analysis
- Used **DAX** to calculate KPIs such as:
  - Overall attrition rate and trends over time
  - Satisfaction scores across different dimensions (job, environment, relationship, work-life balance)
  - Performance rating distributions by department and role
- Built visualizations to compare demographic factors with satisfaction and performance metrics.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Development
- **Overview Dashboard**: Company-wide metrics, hiring trends, and department distribution
- **Demographics Dashboard**: Age, gender, ethnicity, marital status distributions and salary analysis
- **Performance Tracker**: Individual employee performance history and satisfaction metrics
- **Interactive Elements**: Filters, slicers, and drill-through capabilities for detailed analysis
